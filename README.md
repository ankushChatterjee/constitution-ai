# ConstitutionAI

This is  a small experimentation to learn and understand the Indian Constitution with AI.

Tech used:

1. Langchain
2. OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo
3. Pinecone

Constitution file downloaded from  : https://constituteproject.org/

To run the repo:
1. Install the required deps : pinecone-client, openai, langchain.
2. Run `python server.py`
3. Open `frontend/constitutionai`
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `npm run dev`

The code is trash in many places, just wanted to have something up and running.
